<h3>CSS Challenge</h3>
<p>It's the same page which i made in HTML challenge, but in this 3 challenges i added CSS. While doing this page i learned the fundamentals of CSS like selectors (id, class, element) priority, working with colors and pseudo-classes. I also got to know about adding dimensions, centering page, absolute positioning, types of boxes, pseudo-elements. I practiced developer skills like googling and reading documentation.
