It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more. I also learned the fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepared me for the main course project. This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!</p>
