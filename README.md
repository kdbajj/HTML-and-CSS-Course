<h2>Knowledge</h3>
<p>Knowledge from this course help me with doing my own websites. I learned how to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more. I also learned the fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which prepared me for the main course project. This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid :)
