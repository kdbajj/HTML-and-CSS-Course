# Complete HTML and CSS Course

<h2>What does the repository contains?</h2>
<p>The repository contains everything that i learned on the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/">Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS
</a> on the udemy platform.</p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>Knowledge from this course help me with doing my own websites. I learned how to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more. I also learned the fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which prepared me for the main course project. This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid :)
